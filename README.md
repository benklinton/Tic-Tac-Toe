# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple yet devious version of Tic-Tac-Toe. \
The rules are the same as in normal Tic-Tac-Toe. \
Just like the **Millennium Prize Problems** there is a prize for whoever beats this game. \
The prize is as follows: _1 Million US Dollars_ in crypto of choice and eternal fortune and glory.
